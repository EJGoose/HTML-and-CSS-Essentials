# HTML-and-CSS-Essentials
Learning to use HTML and CSS, through a series of challenges increasing in difficulty. 
The challenges were provided by IT Online Learning and contain a prompt and some requirements, to be executed in HTML and CSS.

Each challenge file contains the HTML associated with the challenge, all of the CSS can be found in the CSS folder. 

Challenge 1
- For this challenge I developed a simple template for a Personal Portfolio homepage. Exploring the basics of HTML and CSS.

Challenge 2
- In this challenge the focus was using media queries to create a responsive webpage that would adapt to different size screens without losing functionality.

Challenge 3
- This challenge focussed on exploring more advanced CSS features, such as building a CSS image carosel, and incorporating animations.
